1. fork this repository to your github account,
2. clone the forked repository on *your computer* [1],
3. make some changes to the `CHANGEME.md` file,
4. commit these changes,
5. push the new commit(s) to your online repository,
6. send me an email at maxime.rio@ucl.ac.uk with a link to your repository on github.
